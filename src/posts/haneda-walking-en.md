Hello, this is TrpFrog ([@TrpFrog](https://twitter.com/TrpFrog)). I'm leaving the task alone.

The other day, a group of **3 stupid** 2nd graders (UEC19) and **6 energetic stupid** 1st graders (UEC20) went from the UEC Tama River Ground in Chofu to **Haneda Airport ON FOOT**. Why?????

## November 22, midnight Somewhere in Tokyo

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201123233927 "Chofu Station, 4 HOURS TO FIGHT")

I arrived in Chofu. I don't want to arrive. **The meeting is at 4 o'clock**, but it came at **0 o'clock**. Yes, there is no train in time for **4 o'clock**. Are planners stupid?????

So I came by the last train. **I'm going to blow!**

## 1:00 am

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201123235150 "Midnight wandering is fun!")

I enjoyed reading books and wandering around the station. **Why am I WALKING AROUND before the WALKING party?**

## 3:00 am

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201123234150 "The Last Supper")

I met up with nerds of UEC19 and ate rice at Matsuya. It was delicious. **I'm going home and going to bed today.**

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

As if to break the mood, the person in front of me **finished the spicy food** and had the nerd take a **photo of the announcement of the foolish event**.

It doesn't matter, but dregs of uec19 said,  

```conversation
: Why don't you tweet **"We came Matsuya!"** at 4 o'clock and **piss off the 20 people who are seriously on time for 4:00?**
```

... It's dregs.

This is also unimportant, but one of the most badass tweeters at UEC20, Rupisia, even though I showed her the meeting place on the map, she was 20 minutes late because **she got really lost and ended up in a mysterious park**. **(?)**

 

## 4am

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201123235314 "Be proficient")

Nerds gathered at the meeting place. It was really scary because there were UEC20. **Why are you coming?**

**A few of them were late,** so I said,

```conversation
:Yup! I'm leaving all the late nerds behind!
```

I was going to leave ......, but I felt a little sorry to leave them behind because they are human, so I decided to wait. I was seriously going to leave him behind, but we ...... are too good guys ......(?) üëπ
 

## 5 am 2.3km point

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201123235839 "I'm glad that a tunnel that goes under the bridge suddenly came out")

I arrived at **Tama Suidobashi**. It looked quite far, but this is 2.3km. The destination is long.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201123235844 "I like the road closure so I took a picture.")

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124000223 "I got a good photo and got excited")

It seems to be the first train time.

By the way, there was a **path around the pond(?)** along the river that looked interesting (probably [Kawasaki Mizube no Gakkou](https://goo.gl/maps/PXTy4fQzXm8Nrfew9)), but I decided against it because **the tall grass was growing so thick.** It was still dark and I didn't want to go into the bushes where I couldn't see my feet. ...... Rupi...something said "LETS GOOOO‚ùóÔ∏è" and shoved her **legs zubbed**. I told you so....

## 5:30 am 5.5km point

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124000341 "Nikary≈ç Waterway")

A little off the Tama River and follow **Nikary≈ç Waterway**. Detour \#1. I feel that the water is clean.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124000956 "UEC19 Crossing the Stepping Stones")

Because **we were playing across the stepping stones**, UEC20 gave us a cold stare. **That's enough!** 

It was too far away to be a stepping stone, and it was stupid. It would fall and **I doubt they were "stepping stones" in the first place.**

By the way, it seems that the word **"fall"** was *a forbidden phrase* because **there was an otaku who was in danger of earning credits** on that day. I was messing up.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124001337 "The road under a fairly low railroad track")

**There was a rare type of bridge that passed under the railroad track insanely**. Since the ceiling is a net, it seems that you can see the back of the train when the train passes. I wanted to see it, but I gave up because the train would come 10 minutes later.

## 7:00 am 7.2km point

Huh? You may have thought. **Yes, I played too much in the canal and only progressed about 2 km in 90 minutes.** Hmmm, but I had fun with the stepping stones, so what the heck!

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124002014 "People who can relax at all")

As the sun rises, I get a little impatient. **UEC20 got angry at us, the unhurried 19 trio...**

 

## 7:30 am 7.6km point Kuji Cylindrical diversion

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124002227 "Kuji Cylindrical Diversion")

**While squeezing my ass** As I proceeded, I finally arrived at the detour. **Kuji Cylindrical diversion**.

Circular diversion is a device that "passes water underground, pumps it up, and drains the spring water in several directions." I've heard that it is used to distribute water to multiple canals. Moreover, because it uses the [Siphon Principle](https://news.1242.com/article/126716), there is no need for power or <b> mysterious device-circling slaves </b>. Science is amazing

 

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124002441 "Explanatory sign")

**Can I arrive at the place I'm looking for and go home?**

 

## 7:30 am 8.2km point

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124003940 "Sake Vending Machine")

There was a **liquor vending machine**. **I'm an adult so I'll buy it! I thought** but I couldn't buy it because I don't have a driver's license. Tohoho

If my number card becomes insanely popular in the future, will this also correspond to my number card? I thought, but I was reminded of the reality of losing my number card ** and am rampaging.

 

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124003723 "There is no river but only the bank")

I came to a mysterious area with only a bank. The river is not flowing. **Huh?**

It seems that it was made for water control in the Edo period called "Kuji Kasumi Tsutsumi". If you are interested, please check it out. [Here](https://itot.jp/interview/8065) etc.


## 8 am 9km point

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124004401 "View from Shin Futako Bridge")

I arrived at Shin Futako Bridge. There was **something like a pedestrian bridge** at Shin Futako Bridge, so **the men who absolutely must cross when they see the pedestrian bridge** crossed something like a pedestrian bridge.

It's a pedestrian bridge! !! !! **I was left behind by 20 people walking in front of me ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶**

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/image/upload/v1644000718/blog/haneda-walking/IMG_0439 "Blue: We crossed the bridge according to the pedestrian bridge rules. <br> Green: Forward I thought that the nerds who proceeded with this would also cross over, but <br> Red: The actual Team 20 has forgotten the strange nerds and proceeded üòÖ ")

In such a situation, 20 who was surprised by 19 became almost a different action. Shit ~. So from here on, I, [Atari Fuchino] (https://twitter.com/ebioishii_u), [Kyu ~] (https://twitter.com/kyu_099), [Rupishia](https://twitter.com/lupicure20) are now available. **why?** ((0 guardians))

By the way, "shit" is also a forbidden phrase. I said it about once every 10 seconds, so it was banned. But no one was protecting it. what do you mean?

It seems that it is FamilyMart for offices. Isn't it noisy?

I was distracted by the exclamation mark and forgot what I was doing. I came to look for a toilet.

```conversation
: I can't find the toilet ~
: There is a baby room information board!
: **If you have a baby room, the toilet is also a set!**
: Let's go! By the way, where is the baby room?
: The information board has a **up arrow** written on it! Isn't it on the top?
: Maybe it's in the back!
: I'll go up for the time being!
```

When I went up, I found a map. What! The correct answer for the place where the baby room is located was <b> back </b>. Bad design award. **Write in Japanese!**

However, although the baby room was on the lower floor, the toilet was on the upper floor. As a result, the answer is correct! **What are you talking about?**

 

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124011712 "Thank you @ mato1370!")

I received a mysterious **coffee insert** from an otaku who didn't come on foot here. **Thank you for being cold!** Thank you very much!

 

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/trpfrog/blog/haneda-walking/20201124011932 "Why did everyone bring dolls?")

But **I ordered iced coffee and drank it outside.** why?

Also, at a convenience store in the business district of a fashionable town, a redneck Bakao Taku

```conversation
TrpFrog: Please give me 4 coffees!
Clerk: Is it hot? Is it ice cream? Is it a blend?
TrpFrog: Yeah! !! !! !! !! Kusso ~~~ I don't know ~~~~, which is Kyu-san? How about Atari-san? Hoho ... Rupishia-san ... **It's far, ice cream is fine (miscellaneous)**, please use 4 ice creams.
```

I'm sorry that it took a lot of time to do something like that. What's more, **Naughty Otaku** was stuffed with cinnamon sugar, nut sugar, vanilla sugar, and other fashionable things. **help me.**

On the other hand, the team on the other side of the division was at **Tamagawadai Park** 500m away. It's surprisingly close.

Yes, I knew that **I couldn't arrive in the morning**!
However, it is proceeding smoothly along the Tama River. However, it has become stricter. **Physical condition**. Detours I was able to come smoothly without making a big detour, which is unusual for a nerd. I mean, there are only slides along the river that make detours.

When I returned to the river after stopping at FamilyMart to buy a drink, the nerdy enemy here **Are** appeared.

Looking at the straight course, I started to get really tired.

I did. **It's a hindrance to spread and walk, so let's stop**

That's why I passed through a mysterious section called **Tama River 50km**. The nerd said **"Is there a guy who walks 50km? Isn't he stupid?"**, but I think it's usually a bicycle. You walked too much and said something strange. I thought, but the full marathon is 42.195km, so it wouldn't be strange for some people to run 50km. Bakemon too

I was so tired that I took a break for a while, and when I finished the break and proceeded a little, there was ...

I felt it was a long time from the previous place, but it seems that it came at a surprisingly normal pace. **Worked hard. **Everyone is silent from here. Atari-san is a hero hero, I'm a decent hero hero, Rupia-san is a little further in front, and** Kyu-san is in front of me, isn't it?**

**I also made a nerdy dash to lose** and caught up with Kyu-san. You can only use your physical strength to play around with it ... By the way, I lied, "I can afford it at all!" The liar is the beginning of [Chikuwabu](https://twitter.com/chikuwabu_uec).

Did it! !! !! !! Uhohoi Uhohoi ((https://ainu-upopoy.jp))


## 3:10 pm 28.8km point Haneda Airport Terminal 3

It seems to be a **international terminal**. The characters are cool. How nice! I'm tired, so let's sit down! So I was sleeping in a chair even though I wasn't a passenger. Hmmm, is that okay? I thought, but I suffered from a land trip, so I want you to take a rest. However, I have to go to Terminals 1 and 2 **, so I will leave the chair early.

I also went to the top. It was a time, so it was a rattle. It's an international flight.

For no reason we have to go to Terminals 1 and 2. **On foot.**

Is it a kid?

There was a place that seemed to be a shortcut, so when I went there, it was closed. **Is it harassment?**

But usually I go by train, so I think it means don't walk. I don't know.

<Span style = "font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold"> 3km </span> I was frustrated and bent on such a really long, shit-long, deadly straight road. After walking <span style = "font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold"> 2.5km </span> on a long road and a long tunnel, I finally arrived at Terminal 1. **What's really going on at this airport?**

<span style = "font-size: 1.8em; font-weight: bold"> I did it! Too far! fool! </span>

So I arrived at Terminal 1. I moved to Terminal 2 from here, but I was too tired to sleep in a chair for about 10 minutes. Also, I joined a part of the team over there. Some people seem to have returned. **That's right**

But it's really strange that there is a guy who is arriving like this over there, thank you very much.

Then, proceed through the **underground passage** while squeezing the last force and heading for Terminal 2.

Then use the genius **Keikyu Airport Line** to return. Thank you for your hard work.

was. This is **wandering from Chofu**, not reflected in the distance in the article **spinning around in vain**, **wandering around the store**, **inside the airport It is a value including the amount of rampage**. Also, it is quite suspicious in the article because it is measured roughly with a distance measurement tool.

 

So I will never do it again. good bye
